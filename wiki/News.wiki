=What's Going On with MindTree=

Immediate work has begun on a complete rewrite of MindTree!  This rewrite will take MindTree to the next level: a true end-user application.  To do this, MindTree is being completely rewritten ground-up.  The new MindTree 1.x was written for Python 2.x using the Tk gui development tools.  Python 2.x is showing its age and Tk is has reached obsolesence.

The Python community has nearly completed its work rewriting Python to take the language into the future (Python 3.x, with Python 2.6 as a transition version).is written for Python 2.6 (with Python 3.0 in mind to make the transition to 3.0 easier).  MindTree 2.0 is being written for Python 3.0 (the initial development versions will run on Python 2.6) The GUI is also being rewritten using the state-of-the-art PyQt gui tool.  PyQt makes the addition of new features to MindTree considerably easier.  Future plans for MindTree will be to support such things as printing, Rich Text, Lists and Tables, multiple views of the same outline and drag-and-drop across views.

The decision to go with this redesign has been difficult.  It goes against the existing design philosophy of minimal 3rd party libraries.  However, the change is also necessary to insure that MindTree can advance.
