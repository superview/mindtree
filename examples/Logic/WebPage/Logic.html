S'[[Message]]\n\n   @@ Welcome to The Web Outline of Logic.  I hope you find it a resource for reference and learning.  If you find any mistakes, omissions, inaccuracies or just want to make a general comment or suggestion please {{visit( "mailto:ronpro@cox.net" ): email me }}.\n\n   @@ Thank you and please come back often.  The Web Outline of Logic is always evolving.\n\n[[How To Use]]\n\n   @@ This web page is divided into multiple frames.  The pane on the left contains a navigation tree, while the one on the right (the pane containing this text you are now reading) is the content pane.\n\n   @@ The navigation tree is an outline of articles in this web site.  When you first load this web site, the navigation tree is completely collapsed (meaning you can only see the top-level articles).  Clicking on a [+] will expand one level of the tree while clicking on a [-] will collapse the subtree.  The article titles in the tree which are underlined can be clicked.  This will cause the article to appear in the content frame.\n\n   @@ Every article in the outline is contained in the content pane.  It\'s possible to scroll through all articles in this one frame.  However, this is not reccommended.  The outline in the navigation frame has many levels and it\'s easy to loose the context of any particular article without using the navigation tree.  However, on the chance that you do loose your context, it\'s still possible to locate yourself.  At the top of every article is a \'path\' which shows your location in the tree.  Each branch in this path is separated by a double colon (::).\n\n[[Acknowledgements]]\n\n   @@ This site is MindTree (my own outlining software) written in {{visit( "http://www.python.org" ): python }} using {{visit("http://www.wingware.com"):Wing IDE}}.{{BR}}  The original implementation of the outline was written using {{visit("http://www.natara.com"):Bonsai}} with a simple python program to convert Bonsai files into web pages.\n\n{{PythonLogo}}\n{{WingLogo}}\n{{BonsaiLogo}}'

V{{section( "Description", "text" ):\u000a\u000a   {{item: The criteria for the organization of this outline are first as a reference and second as a tool for learning. The outline begins with a simple definition of Logic as the study and evaluation of arguments. The next topic of the outline is that of arguments.  The primary goal of this section is to introduce the argument from the perspective of the definition of logic provided.  That is, the focus of the section is to give the reader all that's needed to know how to identify and evaluate an argument.  As added material, the last part of the section on argumentation is on argumentation in the real world. Most courses on logic will either skip this part altogether or else just study the subsection on Fallacies.  The fourth section of the outline is a detailed study of the proposition (the first component of an argument).  The fifth section is a detailed study of inference (the second component of an argument).  After that the outline enters into the more advanced topics of metatheory, philosophy of logic, and a study of non-classical logical systems.\u000a\u000a   }} {{item: Future versions of this outline will include syllibi for different courses of study.  \u000a\u000a }} }} }}\u000a

VSecond-order logic includes all the inference rules of the predicate calculus, but the four quantifier rules  of FOL are generalized to permit all four rules for quantifiers binding predicate variables.  the details are fairly straightforward, and we shall not bother to state them precisely here.  We must note, however, that in the application of these inference rules, not only one-place predicates but also open formulas on a single variable are allowed as replacements for predicate variables.  This is because, like one-place predicates, open formulas on a single variable represent properties, though these properties are logically complex.  The example will illustrate.\u000a\u000a1.

V{{section( "Description", "text" ):\u000a\u000a   {{item: The name 'second-order logic' originates with a conception of logic as a hierarchial structure describing individuals, properties, properties of properties, and so on.  Any language whose variables range only over individuals (peropl, trees, electrons, nations, or planets, for example) is a first-order language.  Thus the system of FOL is often called the first-order predicate logic , because its variables stand only for individuals.  Now individuals have a variety of properties (such as being Mexican, being human, and being green), and any language whose variables range just over individuals and their properties is called a second-order language.  Moreover, properties themselves may have properties; the property of being Mexican, for example, has the property of being shared by more than two people.  So there are also third-order languages (whose variables range over indifiduals, their properties, and properties of their properties).  Indeed, there are order n languages for any integer n.  An entire array of such languages is called a type system or theory of types.  \u000a\u000a }} }} }}\u000a

VThe various systems are focused on the meaning of N: and the way that we can use 'Drop Box'.  Gensler's basic system (S5) says that for any proposition N:P, P is true in all worlds (it cannot be false).  Thus, if we have N:P in this or any other world, we may apply the rule 'Drop Box' and move P into any world.  Other systems only allow use to go from N:P to P for suitably related world.  For Gensler, this means we need a 'travel ticket'.\u000a\u000aA travel ticket is dispensed by 'drop diamond'.  When we drop a diamond we move from one world to another, which we may notate as:  'W1 => W2'.  Each system dictates how we may use the travel ticket, all the valid ways that we can use drop box.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

A system that uses two or more logics does {{I:not}} consider the interaction between the separate logics is not a hybrid system.  For example, First Order Logic is usually used in combination with the Propositional logic (that is, a single proposition may contain both quantifiers and truth-functional operators) but is not a hybrid logic because each inference rule is either purely First Order Logic or purely Propositional.  We could turn it into a hybrid logic with the addition of an inference rule such as the following:\u000a\u000a{{OFFSET:\u000a   If P is a one place predicate and a and c are constants, then for any proposition of the form ((Pa \u2227 Pc) \u2227 a=c), we can infer \u2200xPx.\u000a}}\u000a\u000a   @ Clearly this inference rule is nonsensical but its addition to a First Order Logic makes the logic a hybrid because the rule allows an interaction between the two logics being used.  \u000a\u000a }} }} }}\u000a

Does the subject of a universal proposition necessarily exist?  The modern interpretation says 'no'.  And this is reflected in FOL, which is why we can't derive the conclusion, and why the modern square of oppositions is quite a bit simpler than the traditional.

Q ^ -Q	2,4 ^I\u000a6.   p -> ( Q ^ -Q )	3-5 ->I\u000a7.   -P v ( Q ^ -Q )	6 -> Def of ->\u000a8.   -P v F		7 Q ^ -Q = False\u000a9.   -P		8 Identity Property\u000a\u000aThis is sort of interresting, it shows that non-contradiction and excluded middle are needed to prove the Reductio.  But we've used ->I here which is sort of like going backwards.  Let's try the proof without ->.\u000a\u000a1.   -P v Q		A  (P -> Q)\u000a2.   -Q		A\u000a3.   -P		DS\u000a\u000aBut doesn't this proof seem like a cop-out?  Can we avoid using DS?\u000a\u000a\u000a1.   -P v Q		A  (P -> Q)\u000a2.   -Q		A\u000a3.      P		H\u000a4.      Q		1 DS\u000a5.      Q ^ -Q	2,4 ^I\u000a6.   -P v ( Q ^ -Q )	3-5 equiv to ->I\u000a7.   -P v F		6 Q ^ -Q = False\u000a8.   -P		7 Identity Property\u000a\u000aAgain, interresting.  But this proof requires the introduction of a new inference rule allowing us to introduce the premise -P v Q from a hypothetical argument with a hypothesis of P and conclusion of Q.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VIf you setup a truth table of:\u000a\u000aP  Q  -P  P^Q    PvQ    P->Q    P<->Q\u000a------------------------------------\u000aT  T   F     T         T          T            T\u000aT  F    F     F          T          F             F\u000aF   T  T     F          T          T            F\u000aF   F   T     F          F           T            T\u000a\u000aYou will see that in comparing an expression A with an expression B, when B is more generally true than A (true in at least all rows where A is true), then B is trivially inferable from A.  The following inferences (from the table) are all generalizations.\u000a\u000aP ^ Q	|-  P <-> Q	|-  P -> Q\u000a	|-  P	|-  P v Q\u000a	    Q	|-  P v Q\u000a		|-  P -> Q\u000a-P	|-  P -> Q\u000a\u000aSo generalization of an expression is trivial.  Specialization requires justification from at least one additional premise.\u000a\u000aNotice that P -> Q is inferred from -P or from Q.   ( -P v Q -- Hmmm ).  This implied to me that both conditional operators can be removed from the language.  -, ^ and v are truth functionally complete.  Perhaps they are proof unctionally complete as well.

We need to prove that 'a \u2286 b' and 'b \u2286 a'.  But this follows from Proposition 2 and two uses of the indiscrenability of identicals.  To prove the other direction of the biconditional, we assume that 'a \u2286 b' and 'b \u2286 a', and show that 'a=b'.  To prove this, we use the Axiom of Extensionality.  By that axiom, it suffices to prove that 'a' and 'b' have the same members.

Since z e [x], <x,z> e R.  From the fact that ,x,y> e R, using symmetry, we obtain <y,x> e R.  By transitivity, from <y,x> e R and <x,z> e R we obtain <y,z> e R.  But then z e [y], as desired.

VA sound calculus is one in which it is not possible to infer a false proposition given that the premises are consistant.\u000a\u000aProof:\u000a\u000aIn some proof p, show that each step of p is a truth-functional/logical consequence of the assumptions & hypotheses in force at that step.  To prove this claim, we use proof by contradiction.  We suppose that there is a step that is not a consequence of the assumptions & hypothesis in force at that step.  We look at the first such invalid step and show that none of the rules of Fitch could have justified that step.  Thus, we must apply proof by cases to show that, no matter which rule of Fitch was applied at the invalid step, we get a contradiction.\u000a\u000acases follow:  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VA sentence S is satisfiable provided there is a truth assignment h such that h'(x) = true.

(i.e. T is satisfiable if there is one row for which every sentence in T is true).\u000a\u000aThis may seem confusing, but just think of a truth table.  There are two ways to think of satisfiability.\u000a- Is there a situation (row) where all formulas are true?\u000a- Is there a situation (row) which shows that it would be possible to form a conclusion from the set of formulas?  (such a row would be all true - consider how an argument is validated by a truth table).  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VThe sentence S is a truth-functional consequence of the set T if and only if the set 'T union { S }' is not tt-satisfiable.\u000a\u000aNote that if T is finite, we can reduce the question of whether S is a truth-functional consequence of T to the question of whether T ^ S is not satisfiable.\u000a\u000aProof:  We know from the definition of consequence that for every truth assignment h that makes all of the sentences in T true, h(S) is also true.  So this set of sentences T and { S } is satisfiable.  But if we now create h(S) (think of negating all the values in the truth table under S), then we no longer have any truth assignments h in which all the sentences in T are true and so is h(S).\u000a\u000aThe other direction is the converse of the above.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VTheorem:  If a sentence S is a truth-functional consequence of a set T of sentences then T |- S.\u000a\u000aTo show this, we must use proof by contradiction.  We know that for T |- S to be valid, S must be true when all sentences in T are true.  But we can't prove this directly.  We must prove the converse.  That is, if there is no proof of S from T, then S is not a consequence of T.  And if 'T not |- S' then there is an h (see Truth Tables & Consequence) that makes all the sentences in T true, but S false.  In other words, we'll show that 'T union { S }' is satisfiable.\u000a\u000aThis last statement is confusing.  But look at it this way.  Proposition 1 says the following:\u000a\u000a	T  |-  S  <->  Satisfiable( T union { S } )\u000a\u000aIf we negate both sides:\u000a\u000a	T not |- S  <->  Satisfiable( T union { S } )\u000a\u000aWhich is what is said above.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VLemma 2.  'T union { S } |- Q ^ Q, iff T |- S'\u000a\u000aProof:  Assume that 'T union { S } |- Q ^ Q', i.e. that there is a proof of contradiction from premises S and certain sentences P1, ..., Pn of T.  By rearranging these premises, we can suppose the formal proof has the following form:\u000a\u000a	P1, ..., Pn, S  |-  Q ^ Q\u000a\u000aWe can use this proof to construct a formal proof of S from T.  Start with a proof with premises P1, ..., Pn.  Immediately begin a subproof with assumption S.  In that subproof, repeat the original proof of contradiction.  End the subproof and use Intro to conclude S from P1, ..., Pn.  Then apply Elim to get S.  The resulting proof will look like this:\u000a\u000a	P1, ..., Pn, ( S  |-  Q ^ Q )  |-  S  |-  S\u000a\u000aThis formal proof shows that T |- S, as desired.\u000a\u000aNow for the other direction.

VT  |-  (R ^ S), iff T  |-  R and T  |-  S\u000a\u000aFirst, assume that T  |-  (R ^ S).  We will show that T  |-  R.  The proof that T  |-  S will be exactly the same.  Since T  |-  (R ^ S), there is a formal proof of (R ^ S) from T.  And we can take this proof and add one more step.  At this step, write the desired sentence R (or S), using the rule ^Elim.\u000a\u000aFor the other direction, let us usppose that T  |-  R and T  |-  S.  Thus, there are proofs of each of R and S from premises in T.  What we need to do is "merge" these two proofs into one.  Suppose the proof of R uses the premises P1, ..., Pn and looks like:\u000a\u000a	P1, ..., Pn  |-  R\u000a\u000aAnd suppose the proof of S uses the premises Q1, ..., Qm and looks like:\u000a\u000a	Q1, ..., Qm  |-  S\u000a\u000aTo merge these two proofs into a single proof, we simply take the premises of both and put them into a single list.  The we follow them with the steps from the proof of R, followed by the steps from the proof of S.  The citations in these steps need to be renumbered, but other than that, the result is a legitimate proof in fitch.  At the end of this proof, we add a ^Intro of R and S to get R ^ S:\u000a\u000a	P1, ..., Pn, Q1, ..., Qm  |-  R  |-  S  |-  R ^ S  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VT  |-  (R v S), iff T |- R or T |- S\u000a\u000aThe proof from right to left is easy, using the rule of vIntro.  That is Given that T |- R we can add a new step to the end of the proof, vIntro to get from R to R v S.  We gan act similarly going from T |- S to T |- R v S.\u000a\u000aFor the proof of left to right.  That is that if T |- (R v S) then T |- R or T |- S.  This is not true in general, but is for formally consistent, formally complete sets.\u000a\u000aAssume that T |- (R v S), but, toward a proof by contradiction, that 'T not |- R' and 'T not |- S'.  Since T is formally complete, it follows that 'T |- R' and 'T |- S'.  This means that we have two formal proofs p1 and p2 from premises in T, p1 having R as a conclusion and p2 having S as a conclusion.  As we have seen, we can merge these two proofs into one long proof p that has both of these conclusions.  Then, by ^Intro, we can prove R ^ S.  But then using DeMorgans we can extend this proof to get (R v S).  Thus 'T |- (R v S).  But by assumption we also have T |- (R v S).  By merging the proofs of (R v S) and R v S we can get a proof of contradiction by adding a single step.  But this means that T is formally inconsistent, contradicting our assumption that it is formally consistent.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VEvery formally consistent, formally complete set of sentences is satisfiable.\u000a\u000aProof:  Let T be the formally consistent, formally complete set of sentences.  Define an assignment h on the atomic sentences of the language as follows.  If T |- A then let h(A) = true; otherwise let h(A) = false.  Then the funtion h' is defined on all the sentences of our language, atomic or complex.  We claim that:\u000a\u000a	for all wffs S, h'(S) = true iff T |- S\u000a\u000aThe proof of this is a good example of the importance of proofs by induction on wffs. the claim is true for all atomic wffs from the way that h is defined, and the fact that h and h' agree on atomic wffs.  We now show that if the claim holds of wffs R and S, then it holds of (R ^ S), R v S), R, (R -> S) and (R <-> S).  These all follow easily from Lemma 3.  Consider the case of disjunction, for example.  We need to verify that h'(R v S) = true iff T |- (R v S).  To prove the 'only if' half, assume that 'h(R v S) = true.  Then, by the definition of h', either h'(R) = true or h'(S) = true or both.  Then, by the induction hypothesis, either T |- R or T |- S or both.  But then by the lemma, T |- (R v S), which is what we wanted to prove.  The other direction is proved in a similar manner.\u000a\u000aFrom the fact that we have just established, it follows that th assignment h makes every sentence provable from T true.  Since every sentence in T is certainly provable from T, by 'Reit' if you like, it follows that h makes every sentence in T true.  Hence T is satisfiable, which is what we wanted to prove.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VA set of sentences T is formally complete if and only if for every atomic sentence A, T |- A or T |- A.\u000a\u000aProof:  The direction from left to right is just a consequence of the definition of formal completeness.  The direction from right to left is another example of a proof by induction on wffs.  Assume that T |- A or T |- A for every atomic sentence A.  We use induction to show that for any sentence S, T |- S or T |- S.  The basis of the induction is given by our assumption.  Let's prove the dusjunction case.  That is, assume S is of the form P v Q.  By our inductive hypothesis, we know that T settles each of P and Q.  If T proves either one of these, then we know that T |- P v Q by vIntro.  So suppose that T |- P and T |- Q.  By merging these proofs and adding a step, we get a proof of P ^ Q.  We can continue this proof to get a proof of (P v Q), showing that T |- S, as desired.  The other inductive steps are similar.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

The go through these sentences one at a time.  Whenever you encounter a sentence Ai such that neither Ai nor Ai is provable from the set, add Ai to the set.  Notice that doing so can't make the set formally inconsistent.  If you could prove contradiction from the new set, then you could prove Ai from the previous set, by Lemma 2.  But if that were the case, you wouldn't have thrown Ai into the set.\u000a\u000aThe end result of this process is a set of sentences which, by the preceding lemma, is formally complete.  It is also formally consistent;  after all, any proof of contradiction is a finite object, and so could use at most a finite numbe rof premises.  But then it would be a proof of contradiction at some stage of this process, when all those premises had been thrown in.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VThe algorithem for the satisfiability of Horn sentences is correct, in that it classifies as satisfiable exactly the satisfiable Horn sentences.\u000a\u000aProof:  There are two things to be proved here.  One is that any satisfiable sentence is classified as satisfiable by the algorithm.  The other is that anything classfied by the algorithm as satisfiable really is satisfiable.  We are going to prove this result for the form of the algorithm that deals with conditionals.  Before getting down to work, let's rephrase the algorithm with a bit more precision.  Define sets T0, T1, ... of atomic sentences, together with (Q v Q) and (Q ^ Q), as follows.  Let T0 = { Q v Q }.  Let Tn be the set consisting of (Q v Q) together with all atomic sentences 'A' such that (Q v Q) -> A is a conjunct of S.  More generally, given Tn, define Tn+1 to be Tn together with all atomic sentences 'A' such that for some B1, ..., Bk in Tn, (B1 ^ ... Bk) -> A is a conjunct of S.  Notice that Tn subsetOf Tn+1 for each n.  Since there are only finitely many atomic sentences in S, eventually we must have Tn = Tn+1.  The algorithm declares S to be satisfiable if and only if '(Q ^ Q) not in Tn'.  Furthermore, it claims that if (Q ^ Q) is not in Tn, then we can get a truth assignment for S be assigning TRUE to each atomic sentence in Tn and assigning FALSE to the rest.\u000a\u000aTo prove the first half of correctness, we will show that if S is satisfiable, then '(Q ^ Q) not in Tn'.  Let h be any truth assignment that makes S true.  An easy proof by induction on n shows that h(A) = TRUE for each A in Tn.  Hence (Q ^ Q) not in Tn, since h(Q ^ Q) = FALSE.\u000a\u000aTo prove the other half of correctness, we suppose that (Q ^ Q) not in Tn and define an assignment h by letting h(A) = TRUE for A in Tn, and letting h(A) = FALSE for the other atomic sentences of S.  We need to show that h'(S) = TRUE.  To do this, it suffices to show that h'(C) = TRUE for each conditional C that is a conjunct of S.  There are three types of conditionals to consider:\u000a\u000acase 1:  The conjunct is of the form (Q v Q) -> A.  In this case A is in T1.  But then h' assignes TRUE to the A and so the conditional.\u000a\u000acase 2:  The conjunct is of the form (A1 ^ ... ^ An) -> B.  If each of the Ai gets assigned TRUE, then each is in Tn and so B is in Tn+1 = Tn.  But then h' assigns TRUE to B and so to the conditional.  On the other hand, if one of the Ai gets assigned FALSE then the conditional comes out true under h'.\u000a\u000acase 3:  The conjunct is of the form (A1 ^ ... ^ An) -> (Q ^ Q).  Since we are assuming (Q ^ Q) not in Tn, at least one of Ai is not Tn, so it gets assigned FALSE by h.  But then the antecedent of conditional comes out false under h' so the whole conditional comes out true.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VIf T |- S, then S is a first-order consequence of set T.\u000a\u000aProof:  The proof is very similar to the proof of the Truth-Functional soundness theorem.  We will show that any sentence that occurs at any step in a proof p is a first order consequence of the assumptions in force at that step (which include the premises of p).  This claim applies not just to sentences at the main level of proof p, but also to sentences appearing in subproofs, no matter how deeply nested.  The theorem follows from this claim because if S appears at the main level of p, then the only assumptions in force are the premises daws from T.  So S is a first-order consequence of T.\u000a\u000aCall a step of a proof valid if the sentence at that setp is a first-order consequence of the assumptions in force at that step.  Our earlier proof of soundness for fitch was actually a disguised for of induction on the number of the step in question.  Since we had not yet discussed induction, we disguised this by assuming there was an invalid step and considering the first of these.  When you think about it, you see that this is really just the inductive step in an inductive proof.  Assuming we have the first invalid step allows us to assume that all the earlier steps are valid, which is the inductive hypothesis, and then prove (by contradiction) that the current step is valid after all.  We could proceed in the same way here, but we will instead make the induction explicit.  We thus assume tht we are at the nth step, that all earlier steps are valid, and show that this tep is valid as well.\u000a\u000aThe proof is by cases, depending on which rule is applied at step n.  The cases for the rules for the truth-functional connectives work out pretty much as before.  We will look at one, to point out the similarity to our earlier soundness proof.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

V->Elim:  Suppose the nth step derives the sentence R from an application of ->Elim to senteces Q -> R and Q appearing earlier in the proof.  Let A1, ..., Ak be a list of all the assumptions in force at step n.  By our induction hypothesis we know that Q -> R and Q are both established at valid steps, that is, they are first-order consequences of the assumptions in force at those steps.  Furthermore, since fitch only allows us to cite sentences in the main proof or in subproofs whose assumptions are still in force, we know that the assumptions in force at steps Q -> R and Q are also in force at R.  Hence, the assumptions for these steps are among A1, ..., Ak.  Thus, both Q -> R and Q are first-order consequences of A1, ..., Ak.  We now show that R is a first-order consequence of A1, ..., Ak.\u000a\u000aSuppose M is a first-order structure in which all of A1, ..., Ak are true.  Then we know that M |= Q -> R and M |= Q, since these sentences are first-order consequences of A1, ..., Ak.  But in that case, by the definition of truth in a structure we see that M |= R as well.  So R is a first-order consequence of A1, ..., Ak.  Hence, step n is a valid step.\u000a\u000aNotice that the only difference in this case from the ocrresponding case in the proof of truth-functional soundness is our appeal to first-order structures rather than truth table.  The remaining truth-functional rules are all similar.  Let's now consider a quantifier rule.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VSuppose the nth step derives the sentence R from an application of EE to the sentence ExPx and a subproof containing R at its main level, say at step m.  Let c be the new constant introduced in the subproof.  In other words, Pc is the assumption of the subproof containing R:\u000a\u000a	..., ExPx, ..., ( [c] Pc  |-  ...  |-  R  |-  ... ), ...  |-  R\u000a\u000aLet A1, ..., Ak be the assumptions in force at the final step with R..  Our inductive hypothesis assures us that steps ExPx and R (in the subproof) are valid steps, hence ExPx is a first-order consequence of the assumptions in force at that step, which are a subset of A1, ..., Ak, and R is a first-order consequence of the assumptions in force at that step, which are a subset of A1, ..., Ak, plus the sentence Pc, the assumption of the subproof in which m occurs.\u000a\u000aWe need to show that R is a first-order consequence of A1, ..., Ak alone.  To this end, assume that M is a first-order strucure in which each of A1, ..., Ak is true.  We need to show that R is true in M as well.  Since ExPx is a consequence of A1, ..., Ak, whe know that this sentence is also true in M.  Notice that the constant c cannot occur in any of the sentences A1, ..., Ak, ExPx, or R, by the restriction on the choice of temporary names imposed by the EE rule.  Since M |= ExPx, we know that there is an object, say b, in the domain of M that satisfies Px.  Let M' be exactly M, except that it assigns the object b to the individual constant c.  Clearly, M |= Pc, by our choice of interpretation of c.  By Proposition 1 M' |= R, because R is a first-order consequence of these sentences.  Since c does not occur in R, R is also true in the original structure M, again by Proposition 1.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VA sentence cannot always simply be said to be true or false.  But a proposition can.  The sentence, "I am an American."  Would be true if said by Kennedy but false if said by Khrushchev.  Thus, this sentence is not a proposition because the truth is inexact.  However,  "I Kennedy/Khrushchev, am an American." are clearly propositions since they have clear truth-values.  We may say of the first example that it is not a proposition because it may be used to say many different things (Ambiguous? - my note) conversely, different senteces can be used to say the same thing.  (E.g. "It's raining." or "Es regnet.").\u000a\u000aA proposition makes an object out of the notion of what's said or expressed by the utterance of a certain sort of sentence, namely, one in the indicative mood which makes sense and doesn't fail in its references.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VTruth is a relational concept, like 'ungle', consisting in a relation of correspondence to a fact.  (One becomes an ungle by having a niece or nephew.)  A thought or proposition is true in those cases, and only those cases, where there is a corresponding fact of the matter.  (A man is an uncle in those and only those cases where there is a matching nephew or niece.)  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VElementary propositions get their meaning by association with-by corresponding to-particular states of affairs.  The visible (or audible) part of a proposition is a sentence, a sequence of signs.  These signs become symbols by an arbitrary act of correlating them with objects.  Facts about those symbols then come conventionally to picture certain states of affairs about the corresponding objets.  Thus at the heart of Wittgenstein's correspondence theory of truth is a picture theory of meaning.  Elementary propositions are facts about names, and thereby picture (or mean) atomic states of affairs, that is, certain combinations of objects.  In gereral, propositions (via the connection at the base level of elementary propositions and atomic facts) picture putative facts, or states of affairs.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a

VRussell discovered a paradox in Set Theory which nullified Frege's efforts to found mathematics in set theory and logic.\u000a\u000a1.	Sets may contain other sets.\u000a2.	So, a set may be said to always contain itself.  That is, if A is a set, then 'A is a subset of A' is true.  (see Leibniz' Law).\u000a3.	It's also possible that elements of a set may be sets themselves.\u000a4.	So, what about this:  The set of all sets which are not members of themselves.\u000a\u000aIs this last set a member of itself?\u000a\u000aThis is a contradiction of set theory which means that set theory is not valid.  \u000a\u000a }}\u000a
