Compatibility
=============

MindTree 1.5 (or later) is compatible with Python 2.6, PyQt and PyEnchant.

Installation
============

Environment

Before you can run MindTree, you must install the supporting tools: Python,
PyQt and PyEnchant (optional).  These packages are free of cost, available on
the web and very simple to install.  MindTree functions without PyEnchant
installed, however the Spell Checker tool will not work without it.

Python:    http://python.org/download.
PyQt:      http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download
PyEnchant: http://pyenchant.sourceforge.net/download.php

Application

The simplist way to install MindTree is to unzip the downloaded file.

Running MindTree
================

To run, run the MindTree.pyw python script.

In windows you should be able to click on the MindTree.pyw file.  From a
command-line you can type 'python MindTree.pyw'.

What's New
==========
Support for Lists and Tables in Articles.  Default lists and articles are
inserted into the document via the toolbar.  These objects can then be
customized by right clicking on them.
